# TXT

This is a very simple way to create a website. Simply render a `.txt` file in the browser.
It works great, it looks nice enough, it is easy to maintain.
I invite everyone to try to build one for themselves, all it takes is a couple lines you can find in `index.php` and if you want to get a little fancy, a Makefile to wrap your lines at 80ch.
